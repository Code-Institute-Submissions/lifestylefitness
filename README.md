# PROJECT 1 'lifestylefitness'

This project is a front end development exercise that utilizes a bootstrap template that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design". Applying minor embedding of code from other application providers like youtube and Calendly functionality has been added without having to create a full back end integration, which would ultimately be the outlook for the future development of this site. 


# SITE OUTLINE 

## LANDING PAGE

### Navbar 

Contains 'About', 'My Story', 'Transformations', 'Services', 'Contact'. Of these three are sections  ('About', 'Transformations' and 'Contact') and two are linked subpages ('My Story' and 'Services'). 

### Welcome Section 
Is a big hero/masthead section with a 'Get started' button that leads to the first section, the 'About' section. 


### Carousel Section underneath the Welcome Section. 
This section is displaying two services and both are linking to the 'Services' page. 

### About Section

This section is outlining the overall mission of the company.

### Transformations Section 
Here the company showcases the embedded YouTube Transformation story of John Gramlich and two stories of fictitious clients. 


### Contact Section 
In the contact section are a subscribe-to-mailing sign up and the usual contact details for the fictitious company. 

### Footer 
Mainly refers to the project and in a normal company scenario it would provide legal entity references and copyright information. 

## FURTHER PAGES

### My Story Page
This is a summary of the fictitious company owner and personal trainer John Gramlich. Outlined with a timeline and photos of his transformation.

### Services Page

The services page shows two offerings that can be selected with a specific quantity and once the 'Request Now' button is pressed it leads onto the 'Thank you' page. The 'Inquire now' button allows for a pop up integration of Calendly which would allow for a booking for a chat with John Gramlich. 

### Thank you Page 
Is a summary thank you statement with a embedded button at the bottom of the page, that refers to an integration of Calendly which would allow for a booking for a chat with John Gramlich.
